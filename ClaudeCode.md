# Claude Code

## Introduction

Claude Code is a powerful terminal-based coding assistant developed by
Anthropic. It integrates the intelligence of Claude directly into your
development environment, allowing you to work more productively without
leaving the terminal. With support for code understanding, context tracking,
custom workflows, and intelligent suggestions, Claude Code is designed to
streamline your coding experience from end to end.


## Getting Started



### Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code # requires Node.js 18+
```

#### Terminal

```bash
# --> open terminal
cd <repo>
claude
```

#### Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf

```bash
# --> start Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code
# --> install Claude Code by Anthropic extension
# --> open Settings cog
# --> select the "Run Claude Code" icon
# --> SSO authentication
```


### Basic Configuration

```bash
/ide             # Use if running in an IDE window
/terminal-setup  # Enable Shift-Return for multi-line prompts.
/init            # Generates CLAUDE.md, docs project info, any persistent context required
/config          # Verify/update as required
```



# Context

## Files

```bash
$repo/CLAUDE.md         # Project scoped memory checked in
$repo/somedir/CLAUDE.md # Directory scoped memory
$repo/CLAUDE.local.md   # Project scoped memory (not checked in)
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md     # User scoped memory
```

## Managing Context

Claude tracks recent interactions as context for smarter responses.

- Use `@filename` to refer to project files.
- Claude auto-compacts context to stay within token limits.
- Use `/clear` to wipe session memory.
- Use `/focus` to spotlight one file or topic.

```bash
/init
/memory
```

## /clear

Everytime you're done with a feature or bug fix clear your context with
/clear.



# Workflow

## Esc-Esc

Anytime you want to pause/halt an prompt response.  You can pick up directly
from where you paused.

### Shift+Tab

- `Shift-tab` to enter **Auto Accept Edit** indicated by `auto-accept edits on`
- `Shift-tab` to enter **Plan Mode** indicated by `plan mode on`
- `Shift-tab` to enter normal mode requiring edits to be accepted

### Plan Mode

Plan mode will allow you to build up an execution plan with Claude before
executing the plan.



# Configuration

## `$repo/.claude`

Claude uses a hidden directory, `$repo/.claude/`, to store configurations,
hooks, and reusable custom commands. These are shared with your project and
can be versioned via Git.

Example custom command:

```bash
# .claude/commands/gc.md
git add -A
git commit -m "$1"
```

Use `/gc 'your commit message'` to run this sequence.


export CLAUDE_CODE_SHELL_PREFIX="zsh -ic"



## Personalizing Your Setup

You can create a `~/.claude` directory in your home folder. This allows you to define **global commands** that are accessible across all projects.

This is especially useful for things like frequently used shell shortcuts, commit helpers, or standardized code templates.

## Additional Configurations

You can use a configuration file such as `config.yaml` in `.claude/` to customize Claude Code's behavior:

```yaml
indentation: 2
verbosity: detailed
code_style:
  language: javascript
  quotes: single
prompts:
  unit_test_template: "Describe the functionality being tested and the expected outcomes for each scenario."
```

This enables consistent formatting and reusability across prompts.



# Reference

## Images

You can attach images to your conversations for visual reference. On macOS, use `Cmd + Shift + 4` to capture a screenshot. You can drag images directly into the terminal or editor chat window (like Cursor).

Claude will interpret screenshots (e.g., diagrams, error messages) as part of the context.

## Key Bindings

- `Escape`: cancel an active prompt
- `Double Escape`: show Claude menu
- `Shift + Tab`: toggle Plan Mode
- `Up/Down Arrows`: navigate previous prompts

## Automation and Hooks

Claude supports **hooks**: actions triggered by file changes or command completions.

Examples:

- Auto-run linter before each commit
- Generate OpenAPI files and test suite when `.yaml` changes
- Run a test suite whenever a file is saved

Hooks are defined in `.claude/hooks/` and can be chained for multi-step workflows.

## Advanced CLI Options

- `--p`: Use Claude in scripts or batch mode (ideal for CI/CD or automation)
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions`: Allows Claude to run commands without manual approval (use with extreme caution)

These options are ideal for power users integrating Claude into their toolchain.



# Github

## Integration with GitHub

Run `/github-setup` to connect Claude with GitHub. Once linked:

- Claude can review pull requests
- Create PRs based on a description
- Assign issues and reference PRs

This improves developer velocity without leaving the terminal.

## Sound Notifications

You can enable sound alerts when:

- Claude finishes processing a prompt
- Claude awaits your input

This is useful when multitasking so you donâ€™t miss the moment Claude is ready.
