# Run Tests

Execute the test suite for the sync project.

Please execute: `npm run test`

This will run all tests in the test directory, including:
- Unit tests for sync functionality
- Integration tests for local/remote operations
- Priority mapping tests
- Complete/remove operation tests

The tests use the test environment with a separate "Test" Todoist project to avoid affecting production data.
