Update the src/emacs/.emacs.d/initial-buffers.txt file by:
1. Removing any existing file references for files in this sync repo (/Users/shane/src/sync/)
2. Adding current *.md, *.js, and *.el files from this repo
3. Organizing files with comments by type (documentation, core JS, Emacs Lisp, src JS files)
4. Creating the file and directory if they don't exist
